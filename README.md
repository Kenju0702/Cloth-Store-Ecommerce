- Once done, you need to check in docker-compose to see if the image name configuration is the same as the name you built the image with
- Here is an example:
  ```yaml
  warehousedb:
    image: warehouse 
    ports:
      - 3307:3306
    restart: always
  
- If the image name is warehousedb, you must reconfigure it like this.
  ```yaml
  warehousedb:
    image: warehousedb
    ports:
      - 3307:3306
    restart: always

- Once configured, you need to open a terminal and cd to the package containing docker-compose
- Use "docker-compose up" command to use docker-compose
